**NiHao Food Bank Initiative: Brand Visual Guidelines**

This guide provides core principles for the NiHao Marketing Team to ensure all visual communications reflect our mission of community mobilization, friendliness, and professionalism, while maintaining alignment with our core partner, the North Texas Food Bank (NTFB).

**III. Brand Typography**

Typography should be clean, modern, and highly legible across both English and any required Chinese text, reflecting a professional yet approachable tone.

| **Typography Use** | **Suggested Font (English)** | **Suggested Font (Chinese)** | **Style & Guidelines** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Headlines (H1/H2)** | **Gotham** (or a clean sans-serif like Lato/Montserrat) | **Noto Sans SC** (思源黑体) | **Bold/Black** weight. Use **Community Red** or **Friendly Gray**. Should convey strength and focus. |
| **Body Text** | **Arial** (or Roboto/Open Sans) | **Microsoft Yahei** (微软雅黑) | **Regular** weight. Use **Friendly Gray** (#333333) for optimal on-screen readability. |
| **Co-Branded Materials** | Adhere strictly to **NTFB's specified typography** where co-branding is present (refer to the NTFB Brand Guidelines document). |     | Maintain visual consistency with NTFB. |

**Layout Principles**

- **Readability:** Prioritize comfortable font sizes and line spacing for all body text.
- **Hierarchy:** Use size and weight differences clearly between H1, H2, and H3 to guide the reader. Use **Energetic Orange** or **Community Red** strategically for decorative emphasis on key numbers and statistics (e.g., **2.6 Million Meals**).
- **Cross-Cultural Consistency:** Ensure that the same level of care and font quality is applied to both English and Chinese content.

**IV. Brand Tone and Style**

The marketing team must ensure all copy and visual materials align with the following core principles:

- **Neighbor-Centric:** Use language emphasizing mutual aid and partnership (e.g., "our neighbors," "join us," "community strength"), rather than language focused solely on need.
- **Positive & Actionable:** Focus on solutions, progress, and the power of the community. Highlight the impact (e.g., "Over 2.6 Million Meals Enabled") rather than just the problem.
- **Inclusive**
- **Empowering (especially for youth)**

**Sample Messaging:**

- "Together, we inspire youth leadership and build a hunger-free community."
- "Small actions, big change. Every volunteer matters."
- "Empowering the next generation to serve with heart."

**V. Photography & Visual Style**

**Style Direction:**

- **Authentic community moments:** volunteers, families, food distribution, and real interactions.
- **Bright natural light:** conveys hope, youthfulness, and transparency.
- **Multicultural representation:** reflects the Chinese American and broader North Texas community.
- **Action shots:** youth actively participating-packing, lifting boxes, engaging with others.

**Avoid:**

- Overly staged or overly commercial-looking images
- Emotionally heavy or somber photography
- Low-resolution or blurry images

**VI. Brand Applications**

**Usage Scenarios:**

- Social media templates
- PowerPoint decks and one-pagers
- Event banners, T-shirts, stickers
- Newsletters and annual reports
- Volunteer recruitment materials

**Style Recommendations:**

- Generous use of white space
- Incorporate warm color blocks using NiHao Yellow + Warm Sand
- Use NiHao Red for CTAs or key headings
- Choose youthful, positive, energetic photos
